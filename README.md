Signal Clone App using react native expo and firebase


Heres a link of apk for the 1st version:
'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DkknTtcoTNADv7WyjQpnnzuqwivXqQNP'

for the 2nd version for the above which has about screen and contact screen. I was unable to construct the apk due to some discrepancies. But if u run:

'npm install'

then,

'npx expo start' 

it will work
